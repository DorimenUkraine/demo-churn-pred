# Churn Prediction Demo

### Model
To deploy the model on ScienceOps, clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/yhat/demo-churn-pred`), or download the [`churn.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhat/demo-churn-pred/master/model/churn.csv) and [`chrun_model.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhat/demo-churn-pred/master/model/churn_model.py) files.

Put them in the same folder and run `python churn_model.py`. You'll be prompted for your ScienceOps username and apikey. If you don't already have credentials, you can get them here: https://yhathq.com/signup.
